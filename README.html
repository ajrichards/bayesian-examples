<p>There are so many well-written and informative sources of information out there that paper notebooks no longer make the cut (at least for me). This is my attempt to document the things that I intend to use again one day along with their sources.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/lpedit-devs/lpedit">lpedit</a> to run some of the examples. The package has a GUI but the <em>initDocs.py</em> script in each folder will create the pdf report.</p>
<p>There are some important Python packages and software in general that are frequently used throughout.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc">PyMC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net">JAGS</a></li>
</ul>
