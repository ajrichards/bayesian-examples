About
^^^^^^^^^^

Adam Jacob created chef in 2009.

Chef is a configureaiton management tool.  Basically a set of engineering practices
wrt the following when it comes to delivering software applicaitons

   * hardware
   * software
   * infrastructure
   * people
   * process

Inspired by automation theory developed by Anthony Burgess

   * changes must be handled in a systematic fashion
   * some form of autonomy in the system to automatically detect and repair faults
   * other tools  CFEngine, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack

Reasons why?

   * Consistency -- were all the servers setup the same?
   * Efficient change management.
   * Simplicity in rebuild
   * Visibility

Infrastructure as code

   versionable, repeatable, testable
