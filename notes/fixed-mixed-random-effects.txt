Fixed effect: Something the experimenter directly manipulates and is
often repeatable, e.g., drug administration - one group gets drug, one
group gets placebo.

Random effect: Source of random variation / experimental units e.g.,
individuals drawn (at random) from a population for a clinical
trial. Random effects estimates the variability

Mixed effect: Includes both, the fixed effect in these cases are
estimating the population level coefficients, while the random effects
can account for individual differences in response to an effect, e.g.,
each person receives both the drug and placebo on different occasions,
the fixed effect estimates the effect of drug, the random effects
terms would allow for each person to respond to the drug differently.

General categories of mixed effects - repeated measures, longitudinal,
hierarchical, split-plot.
