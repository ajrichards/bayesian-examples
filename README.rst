There are so many well-written and informative sources of information out there that paper notebooks no longer make the cut (at least for me).  This is my attempt to document the things that I intend to use again one day along with their sources.

I use `lpedit <https://github.com/lpedit-devs/lpedit>`_ to run the examples.  The package has a GUI but the *initDocs.py* script in each folder will create the pdf report.

There are some important Python packages and software in general that are frequently used throughout.

   * `NumPy <www.numpy.org/>`_
   * `PyMC <https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc>`_
   * `JAGS <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net>`_
